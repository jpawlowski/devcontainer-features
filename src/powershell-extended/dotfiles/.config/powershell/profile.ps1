# ~/.config/powershell/profile.ps1 - Source: https://github.com/jpawlowski/devcontainer-features/src/powershell-extended/dotfiles/.config/powershell/profile.ps1
# This profile is executed by all PowerShell hosts (e.g., PowerShell console, VSCode Integrated Terminal) on startup for the current user.
#
# Purpose:
# This file is intended for settings and configurations that should apply to all PowerShell hosts.
# It should include non-visual configurations. Visual configurations should be placed in:
# - Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
# - Microsoft.VSCode_profile.ps1
#
# Non-visual configurations include:
# - Functions
# - Module imports
# - Aliases
# - Environment variables
# - PSReadLine configurations (e.g., key bindings, edit mode)
#   - Exception: PSReadLine predictor plugins and other shell completion modules should be placed in host-specific profiles to improve performance.
#
# Note:
# Non-visual configurations are settings that affect the behavior of PowerShell itself, regardless of the host.
#
# Explanation: What is a PowerShell host and a terminal emulator?
# A "PowerShell host" is the application or interface where PowerShell commands are executed. Examples include the PowerShell console, the VSCode Integrated Terminal, and the PowerShell ISE.
# A "terminal emulator" is a program that emulates a video terminal within another display architecture. Examples include VSCode's terminal, Windows Terminal, Apple Terminal, iTerm2, GNOME Terminal, and others.
# The PowerShell host runs within the terminal emulator, providing the environment where PowerShell commands are executed.
# For instance, when you run PowerShell in VSCode, the VSCode Integrated Terminal acts as the terminal emulator, and the PowerShell extension acts as the PowerShell host.
# Similarly, when you run PowerShell in Windows Terminal, Windows Terminal acts as the terminal emulator, and the PowerShell console acts as the PowerShell host.
