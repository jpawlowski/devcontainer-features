Welcome to yet another DevContainer Features repository! This repository extends the official [`ghcr.io/devcontainers/features`](https://github.com/orgs/devcontainers/packages?repo_name=features) main repository
and contains a collection of features to enhance your development environment within a [DevContainer](https://containers.dev/).

You may learn about Features at [containers.dev](https://containers.dev/implementors/features/), which is the website for the dev container specification.

## Features

Below are the features currently available in this repository:

| Feature Name        | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |               Documentation                |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------: |
| CLI Microsoft 365   | CLI for Microsoft 365 is a cross-platform CLI that allows users on any platform to manage various configuration settings of Microsoft 365.                                          | [ðŸ“š Link](./src/cli-microsoft365/) |
| PnP.PowerShell      | PnP PowerShell is a cross-platform PowerShell module that allows users on any platform to manage various configuration settings of Microsoft 365.                                   | [ðŸ“š Link](./src/cli-microsoft365/) |
| PowerShell Extended | Installs PowerShell on AMD64 and ARM64 machines, and optional additional resources from the PowerShell Gallery using PSResourceGet. It also supports advanced installation options. | [ðŸ“š Link](./src/cli-microsoft365/) |

'Features' are self-contained units of installation code and development container configuration. Features are designed
to install atop a wide-range of base container images.

## Usage

To reference a Feature from this repository, add the desired Features to a `devcontainer.json`. Each Feature has a `README.md` that shows how to reference the Feature and which options are available for that Feature.

The example below installs the`powershell-extended` feature declared in the [`./src`](./src) directory of this
repository.

See the relevant Feature's README for supported options.

```jsonc
"name": "my-project-devcontainer",
"image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu",  // Any generic, debian-based image.
"features": {
    "ghcr.io/jpawlowski/devcontainer-features/powershell-extended:2": {
        "version": "7.4"
    }
}
```

The `:latest` version annotation is added implicitly if omitted. To pin to a specific package version
([example](https://github.com/jpawlowski/devcontainer-features/pkgs/container/features/powershell-extended/versions)), append
it to the end of the Feature. Features follow semantic versioning conventions, so you can pin to a major version `:2`, minor
version `:2.0`, or patch version `:2.0.0` by specifying the appropriate label.

```jsonc
"features": {
    "ghcr.io/jpawlowski/devcontainer-features/powershell-extended:2.0.0": {
        "version": "7.4"
    }
}
```
